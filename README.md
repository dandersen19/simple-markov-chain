# simple-markov-chain
Generates a Markov chain trained on any number of input sequences. Developed specifically for musicological applications, though not music-specific in any way.

First, input any number of sequences to create a transition table. Sequence format is a list of integers, representing a sequence of discrete states. To generate Markov chain, specify transition table, starting state, and number of steps to model.
